			<h2>~ Don't worry -- someone will help! ~</h2>
			<p>Ohhh, so many things were difficult at the beginning, and I'm not just talking about learning to code, but learning to navigate the Skillcrush site, figuring out Mightybell, etc., let alone getting going with the html lessons!  But, I discovered during my first chat session on Mightybell (which was in the first week of the course) that help was at hand, not only from the instructors but from my fellow students.  So don't forget to ask for help!</p>
			<h2>~ Lend a helping hand. ~</h2>
			<p>Even as a 'newbie' you can try and help fellow students with their coding problems.  Sometimes a pair of fresh eyes is all it takes to find the problem in the code; other times, you just happen to be able to solve that particular coding challenge more easily than another student, so why not share those insights?  Debugging someone else's code can really facilitate your own learning process.</p>
			<h2>~ The problem is not always with your code. ~</h2>
			<p>But sometimes with the software programs we're using!  I'm thinking of the problems I've had with using IE and JSBin -- untold hours spent trying to figure out the problems with my code when there weren't any!!   
			<h2>~ Practice is key ~</h2>
			<p>Acquiring new skills, new languages, new patterns of thinking all require continual daily practice. When I needed more 'homework' than was provided, I made use of Codecademy and other sites to complement my Skillcrush lessons.</p>
			<h2>~ Don't forget the joy! ~</h4>
			<p>Remember to take a moment to celebrate each coding victory, particularly those that come after a very long slog through the muck.</p>
			<h2>~ And finally, remember, every coder is continually learning. ~</h4>
			<p>So, don't worry if you don't know how to do something now, just go do a bit of research and see if you can figure out how.  If you can't, remember the first point above!</p>
